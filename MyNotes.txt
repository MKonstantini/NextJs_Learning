React Component Types:
1. Client Component (RCC): 
    - Created using 'use client' at the top of the component's file.
    - Cannot read or fetch data.
    - Can handle hooks and user interaction.
2. Server Component (RSC): 
    - The default type of components in Next JS. 
    - Can read and fetch data from a DB. 
    - Cannot handle hooks or user interaction 

Routing:
URL paths are defined by the files and folders in src (not every file = route).
Important to closely follow the Next JS conventions for creating routes:
- All routes must be placed inside the app folder.
- All folders correspond to a path segment in the URL.
- All route files must be named page.js or page.tsx.
- Create nested routes by creating folder + page inside a route folder.
- Create dynamic routes (/:id) using [id] as folder name.
- All pages have route params as intrinsic props - Component({params}) {params.id}.
- Can catch-all URL segments using folder name [...slug] - Component({params}) {params.slug[0]} 
- Adv. catch-all that includes parent folder when routing: [[...slug]]
- 404 Not Found page is created automatically by Next JS.
page.tsx in app is the home page (localhost:3000).
page.tsx in app/about is the about page (localhost:3000/about).
